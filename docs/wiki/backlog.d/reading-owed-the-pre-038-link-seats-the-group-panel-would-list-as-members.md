## Reading owed - the pre-038 link seats the group panel would list as members

target: 1.7.0

**What is built:** the pre-038 link seats the group panel would list as members (found 2026-10-25; the group panel reads `user-members` and drops only `awaitingAdmission` seats)

**The reading that closes it:** ONE read-only production count: roster rows with no active or admitted device of that user in that group. 0 closes it; otherwise a backfill migration (additive, reviewed, backed up just before, owner's rule of 2026-11-01)
