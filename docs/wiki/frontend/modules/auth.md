# Auth module

**Routes**: `src/routes/login/`, `src/routes/auth/callback/`  
**Components**: `src/lib/components/auth/`  
**Store**: `src/lib/stores/auth.svelte.ts`

## Responsibilities

- OIDC login via Authentik (redirect flow with PKCE).
- Dev login (email/password) when `ENABLE_DEV_ROUTES=true`.
- Access token management (in-memory only).
- Refresh token rotation via HttpOnly cookie.
- WebSocket auth cookie (`canari_ws_token`) synchronization.
- PIN setup and verification (used to encrypt MLS state).

## Login flow

```
/login -> startOidcLogin()
  -> redirect to Authentik /authorize (PKCE + state)
  -> callback to /auth/callback?code=...&state=...
  -> POST /api/auth/oidc/callback { code, redirect_uri }
  -> store access_token in memory
  -> set canari_ws_token cookie
  -> redirect to /chat
```

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/login` | Login page (OIDC button + optional dev form) |
| `/auth/callback` | Receives OIDC auth code, completes login |

## Auth store

```typescript
// auth.svelte.ts
export const currentUser: Writable<User | null>;
export const accessToken: Writable<string | null>;

export function setWsSessionCookie(token: string): void;
export function clearWsSessionCookie(): void;
export async function refreshAccessToken(): Promise<string | null>;
export async function logout(): Promise<void>;
```

`apiFetch.ts` intercepts 401 responses: it calls `refreshAccessToken()` once and retries. If refresh fails, it clears the session and redirects to `/login`.

## PIN and device key

The PIN itself never encrypts anything and never leaves the device. It is the input to two
domain-separated PBKDF2-SHA256 derivations over the same server-issued salt:

| Derivation | Where | Iterations | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `computePinVerifier` | `crypto/pinVerifier.ts` | 100 000 | Sent to `POST /api/mls/security/pin-check`; detects a PIN changed on another device |
| `deriveDeviceKeyB64` | `crypto/deviceKey.ts` | 310 000 | 32-byte at-rest key (`deviceKeyB64`) - the only thing that decrypts `mls.bin` and local messages |

`deviceKeyB64` is the single at-rest key: `mls.bin` is ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`[nonce 12 || ct]`),
local messages are AES-256-GCM (`[iv 12 || ct]`). Rotating the PIN re-derives the key and
re-encrypts both (`utils/chat/pinChange.ts`).

**PIN policy** (`utils/chat/pinValidation.ts`): at least 4 characters, no upper bound and no
character-set restriction, checked by the single `isValidPin` on every path (first setup, PIN
change, recovery, unlock). The rule is deliberately uniform: the device key derives from the
exact string typed, so any check a PIN could pass at creation but fail at unlock would lock its
owner out of their own messages.

### Where the key lives

| Storage | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Device key vault (`utils/deviceKeyVault.ts`) | PIN login | AES-GCM-wrapped key in `sessionStorage`, or `localStorage` when "stay signed in" is on (`canari_device_key_persist`) |
| Platform keystore, alias `mls_device_key_{userId}_{deviceId}` | `store_push_context` (Tauri) | Biometric unlock and background FCM decryption |
| `push_context.json` | `store_push_context` (Tauri) | Native background decryption; holds `deviceKeyB64` in cleartext app data by design - enrolling biometrics changes the *unlock method*, not where this copy lives |

Enrolling biometrics wipes the vault (`clearDeviceKeyAndWrapKey`) and turns "stay signed in" off,
so the next launch goes through the keystore. A PIN change must **not** delete the keystore entry:
`IMlsService.changeDeviceKey` has already overwritten it with the new key.

## Mobile unlock flow (Tauri)

Driven by `startLoginFlow()` in `components/layout/ChatBackgroundService.svelte`.

**First sign-in** — OIDC, then the PIN sheet (with the "stay signed in" opt-in). Immediately after
the PIN is accepted, `BiometricEnrollSheet` offers biometric unlock, but only if the hardware is
available, biometrics are not already configured, and the offer was not previously declined. It
cannot be offered earlier: the device key does not exist until the first PIN entry. Declining is
permanent (`canari_biometric_prompt_dismissed` in `localStorage` **and** the native flag
`biometricPromptDismissed`, so it survives an Android process kill).

**Later sign-ins** — with biometrics enrolled, `BiometricBottomSheet` opens alongside the OS prompt.
On failure or cancellation there is no silent fallback: the PIN sheet opens, keeping the "use
fingerprint" button so the prompt can be retried (the button is hidden when no biometric is
usable). With a stored key and no biometrics, login is silent; the PIN sheet only appears if it
fails.

`BiometricBottomSheet` is rendered once and serves both flows; the enrolment variant is raised from
`enrollBiometricImpl` through the `biometricPrompt` store, so the post-login offer and the Settings
toggle behave identically.

### Login failure codes

`session/loginErrors.ts` defines `LoginFailure` with a machine-readable `LoginErrorCode`
(`pin_mismatch`, `state_sealed_with_old_key`, `keystore_empty`, `device_revoked`, `other`), passed
to `onLoginFailed(message, code)`. **Branch on the code, never on the message**: the message is
localized, so a regex over it silently stops matching in another locale - that is exactly how the
cross-device recovery link once became unreachable in French.
