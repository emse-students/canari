# media-service

**Stack**: NestJS  
**Port**: 3011  
**Source**: `apps/media-service/`

## Responsibilities

The media-service is the encrypted blob store. It:

- Accepts encrypted file uploads from clients; stores blobs in MinIO (S3-compatible).
- Exposes download endpoints (authenticated for private blobs, public for profile images).
- Supports both single-shot uploads and chunked uploads for large files.
- Auto-resizes public images (logos, avatars) to 512x512 WebP on upload.
- Never decrypts content — the client provides AES-256-GCM ciphertext; the encryption key travels inside the MLS ciphertext.

## Encryption model

```
Client:
  - Generates a random CEK (AES-256-GCM, 256-bit)
  - Encrypts the file with the CEK
  - Uploads ciphertext to media-service
  - Sends the CEK inside the MLS message ciphertext

Server:
  - Stores opaque bytes in MinIO
  - Returns a mediaId
  - Never sees the plaintext or the key
```
