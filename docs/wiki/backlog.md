# Backlog

**Everything below is SCHEDULED** - the user's decision of 2026-08-18: the backlog and `CLAUDE.md`
are both emptied before the campaign restarts. This file is no longer a parking area; it is the
DETAIL for the queue in `CLAUDE.md`, which carries the order and one line per item. Read the order
there, the substance here, and delete an entry from BOTH when it ships.

The exception is the handful that genuinely cannot be pulled forward - blocked upstream, blocked on
an iPhone that does not exist, blocked on credentials somebody else owes, or post-campaign by the
user's own decision. Each says which it is, and `CLAUDE.md` lists them together at the end of the
queue so that "not scheduled" never has to be inferred.

Severity uses the repo scale: **P1** security, or a user-facing path that is broken - **P2**
correctness, nothing at risk - **P3** hygiene. An item with no severity is a QUESTION, not a defect,
and its first task is to answer the question rather than to write code.

Each entry states what is known, so that picking it up does not start with a rediscovery. **Delete an
entry outright when it ships** - the rule goes to [durable-rules](durable-rules.md), the story to
`CHANGELOG.md`, the mechanism to the wiki page that entry points at. An entry describing its own fix
is an entry nobody trusts to be current.

## Security - blocked upstream

### P2 - `libcrux-chacha20poly1305` panic on an overlong ciphertext buffer, in the MLS path

**The only one of the 16 open Dependabot alerts that reaches attacker-controlled input on a path that
matters.** `frontend/mls-wasm/Cargo.lock` pins 0.0.7; the advisory is fixed in 0.0.8. It arrives
transitively as `openmls_rust_crypto` → `hpke-rs` → `hpke-rs-libcrux` → `libcrux-aead` →
`libcrux-chacha20poly1305`, i.e. it IS the HPKE half of the MLS crypto provider, and it processes
ciphertext supplied by whoever sends this device a frame. A panic there kills the MLS client inside
the WASM module. Availability, not confidentiality - no key material is exposed.

**It cannot be bumped today, and this was tried rather than assumed.** `libcrux-aead 0.0.7` pins
`libcrux-chacha20poly1305 = "=0.0.7"`, and a `0.0.x` requirement is exact in Cargo semver, so the
whole chain has to move together:

| crate                      | locked | needed | available                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `libcrux-chacha20poly1305` | 0.0.7  | 0.0.8  | yes                                                  |
| `libcrux-aead`             | 0.0.7  | 0.0.8  | yes                                                  |
| `hpke-rs-libcrux`          | 0.6.1  | 0.7    | yes                                                  |
| `hpke-rs`                  | 0.6.1  | 0.7    | yes                                                  |
| `openmls_rust_crypto`      | 0.5.1  | 0.6    | **release candidates only** (0.6.0-rc.1, 0.6.0-rc.2) |

So closing this alert means shipping a release candidate of the MLS crypto provider. That is not a
dependency bump, it is an openmls provider upgrade with a full MLS re-verification behind it, and it
must not ride along with anything else.

**Re-check when `openmls_rust_crypto 0.6.0` goes stable** - that is the whole condition. Until then
the alert stays open on purpose, and the reason is here rather than in somebody's memory.

## Open questions - no code until they are answered

### P2 - what made the profile fetches fail on that device at that moment

**The MECHANISM is closed** (2026-08-16): the swallowed `catch` now accuses, a reconnection clears
`failedAt` because a failure recorded while the network was down is evidence about the network rather
than about the user, a failed lookup answers `null` instead of the label that overwrote names the
caller already had, and `displayName.spec.ts` pins all of it.

**What is owed is the DENOMINATOR, and it is a measurement rather than a change.** The log line that
makes it countable did not exist when the symptom was seen - twice on 2026-08-16, on both platforms,
nine of ten sidebar rows carrying "Utilisateur inconnu" for twenty seconds. Do not assume it is the
same fault as the avatar endpoint, and do not assume it is not.

**The denominator now rides ON the accusation (2026-08-19).** `displayName.ts` counts the lookups
that actually reached the network - a cache hit, the current user, the `system` sender and a lookup
already suppressed by the backoff are all excluded, because counting them would drive the rate
towards zero exactly as the cache warmed and measure the cache rather than the fault - and every
warn now ends `(failed/attempted lookups failed this session, X%)`. One line answers both "did a name
get lost" and "how often does that happen here", which is the question the backoff turns on.
`displayNameLookupStats()` exposes the same numbers to a test or a debug surface.

**Where the number will come from:** the campaign run logs, on both platforms. Nothing here is sent
anywhere - there is no client telemetry and this did not add any - so the rate is read from a device
or a browser console during a run, which is exactly where the symptom was seen. Server-side is not
an option: `GET /api/users/:id` is not request-logged, and a client that never reached the network
would not appear there anyway.

**Then decide about `FAILURE_BACKOFF_MS`.** A high rate argues the two-minute suppression is doing
real work against a refusing server; a rate near zero argues it is a clock hiding a name for two
minutes over a blip that the reconnection listener already handles.

### QUESTION - does an iOS attachment CONSUME the avatar cache file it is handed?

Found 2026-08-17 while writing the initials fallback, and it is a question rather than a defect
because settling it needs an iPhone. `CanariShowLocalNotification` hands `attachmentPath` straight to
`UNNotificationAttachment`, and for an avatar that path IS the durable cache file `avatar_<id>.jpg`
that `CanariFetchAvatar` writes and later re-reads. The NSE does the opposite on purpose: its
`attachImage` copies to a temp file first, carrying the comment *"an attachment URL is
consumed/moved by the OS, so we never hand it a shared cache file directly"*.

Both cannot be right. If the OS really moves the file, the app-process cache is emptied by its own
first hit and every subsequent notification re-fetches - a silent, permanent cache miss that no log
would name, since a re-fetch looks exactly like a first fetch. **What settles it is one device
observation**: notify twice for the same person with the app alive, then look for `avatar_<id>.jpg`
in the app container. If it is gone, the app path copies too, exactly as the extension does. The
initials disc is unaffected either way - it writes to `NSTemporaryDirectory()` on both.

### ANSWERED 2026-08-19 - what a full disk and an evicted store actually do

Both questions were the same shape: five years on a device and ninety days on the web are TIME
bounds, so nothing caps the store by SIZE, and the failure was undesigned rather than designed. Both
were settled by INJECTION and never on the campaign phone (the user's decision, 2026-08-19): the
appliance the campaign depends on is not the place to find out.

**Two defects fell out of asking**, and both are fixed:

- **Tauri caught a failed SQLite open and answered with IndexedDB in the same webview.** The MLS
  state persister writes `mls.bin` to the filesystem and does not follow that choice, so the group
  state would have stayed on disk while conversations and messages moved into the webview's store -
  a client that opens, looks healthy, and whose history does not match its own ratchet. And the
  cause it existed for is the one it cannot survive: the second store is on the same full disk.
- **A blocked IndexedDB upgrade never settled the promise.** `onblocked` fires when another tab
  holds an older version open - neither `onsuccess` nor `onerror` - so `init()` simply stopped, with
  no bound and nothing logged. It now rejects and says which tabs to close. The open failure also
  carries the browser's DOMException as `cause` instead of the string `'IndexedDB open error'`.

**Eviction needs no machinery, and that is a decision.** It drops the whole origin bucket, so the
next open finds no database and hands back an empty store - byte for byte what a browser that has
never seen Canari does, because everything that could have told them apart was in the bucket too. An
empty store IS a new device, the new-device path already exists, history replays from the server and
the MLS state is re-established by enrolling. A client that claimed to know it had been evicted
would be claiming knowledge it does not have.

The shapes are on [frontend/architecture](frontend/architecture.md#when-the-local-store-fails) and
pinned by `src/lib/db/storageFaults.test.ts`. **No SIZE cap is proposed**: a write that fails now
reaches its caller on every backend, which is what the cap would have been protecting.

### Is a MiGallery application worth it?

An open question, deliberately. The Canari formula (SvelteKit + Tauri) transfers, so the cost is
knowable - but MiGallery's value is a gallery that a browser already renders well, and the question
is what an app would add that the web version cannot do. Answer that before estimating anything.

---

## Measurements owed

### P2 - measure EGRESS over time, because two unrelated upstreams stalled in one window

The code half is fixed: `UpstreamUnreachableError` classifies at the throw, so an unreachable host is
a **502 `no-store`** never remembered, while an answer about the URL stays a cacheable 400; and
`OUTBOUND_BUDGET_MS` is the single budget, set on the `AbortController` AND on the undici dispatcher,
so the stated budget is the one that fires. Pinned by `security.controller.link-preview.spec.ts`.

**What is owed is not a code change.** Within one three-minute window on 2026-08-15, two unrelated
upstreams timed out from two different containers (`chat-delivery-service` → Wikipedia at 14:37:02,
`core-service` → gallery at 14:39:58). That is not evidence about either upstream, and it is the
second time this shape has been mistaken for one - the IPv6 reading was refuted by measuring the
components, which all came back healthy. **Measure EGRESS over time rather than the endpoints again**:
the component probes already say each is fine at the moment it is asked, so what is left to establish
is whether these stalls are CORRELATED, which a one-shot probe cannot answer by construction.

**ARMED 2026-08-19.** [`infrastructure/egress-probe/`](../../infrastructure/egress-probe/README.md)
takes a sample a minute - both stalled upstreams, the tunnel back to ourselves, a control at 1.1.1.1,
and the same target from inside `chat-delivery-service` through Node's own fetch - with DNS, connect
and TLS recorded apart from the total. `report.py` prints each conditional rate beside the base rate
it has to beat. Installed in the `canari` crontab, verified writing, `probe.err` empty.

**This item cannot be closed by working on it.** A report over a quiet week says the week was quiet.
Read the ledger the next time a stall appears in a service log; that is the moment the two
hypotheses differ, and the stall will already have been measured.

---

## Communities and permissions

Six entries came out of ONE audit on 2026-08-17, prompted by a user question rather than by a
failure. **All six are closed as of 2026-08-19** and are not repeated here - the last one, two communities
sharing a name, the user closed by decision rather than by code (2026-08-19: it is not a defect).
The five that shipped on 2026-08-18: the mechanism is on
[social-service](services/social-service.md#a-community-always-has-an-admin-or-it-has-no-members-2026-08-18),
the audit and its prod figures on [community-rework](services/community-rework.md), the rule in
[durable-rules](durable-rules.md), and the story in `CHANGELOG.md`. **Nothing is open here**: the
last entry, a private salon's seed being sealed to the whole community, closed on 2026-08-20.

### CLOSED 2026-08-20 - a private salon now has its own distribution group

Shipped, with the user's decisions of 2026-08-19 in it: an admin JOINS explicitly (member list only,
no system message), an unjoined private salon stays VISIBLE to an admin so the join is reachable,
and forward secrecy is decided AGAINST - the reasoning on the last one is not to be re-opened
(Graine retains seeds so a joiner reads the past, channel messages are not persisted locally, so a
forgotten seed would cost a member their OWN scrollback; the exposure is bounded by the retention
window of §8 plus `history_visibility: joined`).

The design, the lifecycle table, the client changes and the one defect found while writing it up (a
discriminator `mlsDeliveryApi` dropped in transit) are on
[graine §13](protocols/channel-encryption.md#13-one-distribution-group-per-private-salon---shipped-2026-08-20),
which is the only copy. Production held ZERO private salons when it was measured on 2026-08-19, so
no backfill was written and the migration question is moot.

---

## Storage and retention

The server side has a page already - [storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md) - and it
is where any measurement belongs.

### Server - can occupancy be monitored, and will it hold?

**The media half shipped 2026-08-18** and is documented on
[storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md): `/admin/storage` now separates growth (bytes
written per 7-day window) from a retention sweep that has stopped taking anything, and counts
separately the objects no sweep can EVER reach. That last one was not hypothetical -
`purgeExpiredMedia` iterates the metadata index, so an object with no entry is invisible to it for
ever, and 7 such objects (~11 MB) were already measured.

**The MLS half shipped 2026-08-19**, and this entry is closed. Postgres and Redis are no longer bare
totals: the panel lists the eight MLS tables by size with their row counts, reports the queue as four
figures (total, devices, oldest, and the DEEPEST single device queue - the one a total cannot show),
counts §5.7's WP-GHOST-1 shape continuously, and breaks Redis down by key prefix from a bounded
sample that says how much it sampled. The production baseline and the reasoning are on
[storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md); do not restate them here.

**Decided 2026-08-17: the panel is the whole of it, there is NO alert.** The user's call. Worth
stating what that costs rather than pretending it costs nothing - the standing rule is that a correct
mechanism with no report is found by hand a day late, and a panel is a report only for whoever opens
it. The slope is what makes it survivable: a number read once a month against a trend is enough to see
a wall coming, where a bare total is not. **§5.7's own "more than a few hundred rows" predicate is
deliberately left unarmed**: the deepest real queue is 189, so a threshold set from the last incident
would be a threshold nobody has measured against the population it would run on.

> **Already shipped, do not re-open:** _"ne garder que les messages les plus recents (dernier mois),
> et le reste recuperable en demandant l'historique a un appareil mobile"_ is exactly the device
> window plus the scrollback range request delivered in the history-reconciliation rework - web keeps
> 90 days, mobile and desktop 5 years, and reaching the top of the scrollback asks a peer for the
> range below the window. See [history-reconciliation](protocols/history-reconciliation.md) and
> `historyWindow.ts`.

> **Already shipped, do not re-open:** _"pourquoi garder plus d'un accuse de lecture sur de vieux
> messages ? Si le dernier message a ete lu, le precedent aussi"_ is the read watermark that replaced
> per-message `readBy` in the same rework - read state is now ONE timestamp per (conversation, user),
> and `readersOf` derives the per-message display from it.

## Payments

### Flipping `payment_provider` from Stripe to Lydia (WP-LYDIA-1)

**The code is not the blocker - it is already written and tested.** `PaymentProvider` is an interface
(`apps/core-service/src/payment/payment-provider.interface.ts`), `LydiaPaymentProvider` implements the
two flows that map cleanly onto it (one-off checkout, session lookup) with its own signature module
and specs, and the choice is a platform config column (`payment_provider`) that **defaults to
`stripe`**. Stripe is what runs today and nothing about that is broken.

What is missing is not code, which is why this is a question and not a P-anything: the **credentials**
and the **answers Lydia owes**. Everything that does not map - live balance and status, saved payment
methods - throws a documented error rather than faking a result, and that is deliberate: Lydia has no
live status-poll endpoint, and the saved-card flow was **explicitly dropped by the user** rather than
reimplemented, so every purchase becomes its own interactive request. Do not re-litigate that.

The full provider mapping, the remaining open questions and the credentials still owed are in
[`plans/stripe-to-lydia-migration.md`](../../plans/stripe-to-lydia-migration.md), which the wiki page
[payments](frontend/modules/payments.md) already points at.

**2026-08-19: onboarding storage coexists (see [core-service#payments](services/core-service.md#payments-stripe--lydia)),
and checkout routing now does too.** `resolvePaymentTarget` (`payment-delegation.util.ts`) takes the
active provider as a parameter and resolves against the matching column pair; `AssociationsService`/
`ProductsService` fetch it from the public `GET /api/payments/provider` before resolving, and let a
failure to reach core-service propagate rather than guess. `PaymentTarget.connectAccountId` (renamed
from `stripeAccountId`) now genuinely holds whichever provider's account is active. A Lydia
`request/do` payment is also confirmed server-side now: `confirm_url`/`cancel_url`/`expire_url` are
registered per-request, and `POST /api/payments/lydia-request-callback`
(`webhook.controller.ts`) verifies the signature and fans out to the same submission/purchase
fulfillment Stripe's webhook already used, via a shared `order_ref` encoding
(`form:<submissionId>` / `product:<productId>:<userId>`, parsed by `lydia-order-ref.ts`).

**Two things still block actually flipping the switch, both found while wiring this:**
1. **`payerRecipient` is never supplied.** `LydiaPaymentProvider.createCheckoutSession` throws
   without it (`request/do` needs the payer's email/phone), and nothing in `products.service.ts`/
   `forms.service.ts` resolves one - the interface field has existed since Phase 2 but no caller was
   ever wired to it. Needs a design decision on where the payer's email comes from for a boutique
   purchase (a logged-in user's account has no email stored in social-service today; only forms with
   a guest `input.email` field have one at all).
2. **The `business/create` `BUSINESS_VALIDATED`/`BUSINESS_UNVALIDATED` webhook is deliberately not
   built.** It has no documented signature and `vendor_token` is PUBLIC - building it as-is would let
   anyone knowing another association's vendor_token forge or break its `lydiaOnboardingComplete`,
   with no resync since Lydia sends the event once. Add "does `business/create`'s `webhook` param
   have a signature scheme?" to Livrable A below before building this.

---

### MEASURED 2026-08-20 - a role change does not reach the person it is about

**COMM-5 passes and records `liveWithoutReload: false`.** The promotion itself is immediate and
correct - `member` -> `moderator` -> `admin` -> `member` on the server, each step landing before the
next was asked for, and the owner's own panel showing each one. What does not happen is the OTHER
device learning about it: the peer gained the manage controls only after a full reload, and the wait
that says so is bounded at 20 s and reported next to the answer.

**Which direction matters is the demotion, not the promotion.** A promoted moderator who cannot
moderate until they reload is an annoyance. A DEMOTED administrator goes on being offered every
control they have just lost, for as long as their tab stays open. That is not a security hole - the
server re-checks every one of them, and the components say so in their own comments ("hiding the
button is convenience, not the gate") - but it is a person clicking things that will now fail, with
no explanation on screen.

**DECIDED 2026-08-20 by the user, and SHIPPED the same day: PUSH IT.** `workspace.role.changed`
carries the new role's whole permission set to the member it concerns and to nobody else, and their
client applies `viewerCanManage` from the event - it does not refetch, because a refetch can fail,
can be declined while a load is already in flight, and would return exactly what the event already
carries. Best-effort and logged: the role is written before the announcement is attempted, so a
failed publish leaves the member where they were before any of this existed. COMM-5 is now STRICT on
`liveWithoutReload` and keeps the reload path only to separate "the push did not arrive" from "the
grant never happened".

**The invariant this rests on, written down because nothing enforces it:** `viewerCanManage` is the
only permission-derived value the client caches. The event carries the full list so that the day a
second one is cached, only the client handler changes.

### FOUND 2026-08-20 - a custom role can be created by the API and by nothing else

`POST /channels/roles` exists, `ChannelService.createRole` on the client exists, and **no component
in the application calls it**. The roles tab renders a permission grid over whichever roles the
workspace already has - the three defaults - and offers no way to add a fourth. Enumerated, not
assumed: `createRole` has exactly two non-test references in the frontend tree, its declaration and
nothing else.

**DECIDED 2026-08-20, by the user: THREE ROLES IS THE PRODUCT.** `ChannelService.createRole` is dead
client code and is deleted; COMM-6 is rewritten to ask what the grid actually does - that it offers
exactly the six enforced permissions and no seventh, and that a toggle on it is enforced.

**The server route is KEPT, and this is the reasoning rather than a shrug.** `POST /channels/roles`
is the only way a custom role can exist at all, and the grid renders whatever roles a workspace has
- so a role made through the API is visible and editable, just not creatable, and the interface
degrades into read-and-edit rather than breaking. Deleting the route would also delete the tested
service method behind it and the migration history that shaped it, for no gain: nothing calls it, so
nothing costs anything. **The one wart worth writing down:** `normalizeRoleLabelToCanonical` folds
any unrecognised role name to `member`, so a custom role shows in the member list as "Membre" while
holding whatever permissions it was given. That is a display fault waiting for the day somebody uses
the route, not today's problem.

**What is NOT in doubt** is the six: `channel.access` and `channel.send` are out of the registry, out
of the grid and out of `channel_roles.permissions` by migration, and `RETIRED_PERMISSIONS` keeps
their names only so an old client's write can be told from a wrong one.

### CLOSED 2026-08-20 - deleting a salon archived it, after destroying its key

`DELETE /channels/:channelId` set `channels.archived = true` and, in the same call, destroyed the
salon's key-distribution group. A private salon therefore ended as ciphertext nothing holds a seed
for: invisible to every listing, unreachable by every route, with no un-archive anywhere in the
service, and removable only by deleting the whole community. That is the shape `deleteWorkspace`
had rejected on 2026-08-18, one scope up, in the same words - the fix was written as a sentence
about a mechanism and applied to exactly one caller of it.

**Found by COMM-16**, whose `channelRowGone` came back false on its first run, and very nearly lost
by "fixing" the check to match the code. Now shipped: the salon, its `channel_messages` and its
group are deleted, group first and allowed to abort; both `archived` columns dropped by migration
046 (prod held zero archived rows in either); six tests in `channel-delete.spec.ts`, which the route
had none of. No confirmation argument, deliberately - reasoning on
[social-service](services/social-service.md#deleting-a-channel-took-no-new-argument-deliberately-2026-08-20).

### P3 - an admin who never joined a private salon is not told when it is deleted

`channelAudience` is the salon's roster, and since 2026-08-19 an administrator reaches a private
salon by JOINING it rather than through `workspace.manage` - so one who has not joined is not on the
roster and receives no `channel.deleted`, nor any other event the salon emits. They ARE shown that
the salon exists (name only, `viewerHasAccess: false`), so their sidebar keeps a row for something
that is gone until their next load.

**Not fixed by widening the audience**, which is the obvious move and the wrong one: that is exactly
what put every private salon's messages, typing, pins and poll tallies on the socket of members the
same server refuses to serve them over REST, and it was closed this week. The shape that would work
is a separate, contentless `channel.gone` addressed to the community - worth doing only if the stale
row is ever seen to matter, since a reload clears it and nothing is wrong underneath.

## Post-campaign projects - decided, not scheduled

### The MLS + Graine explanation, written FOR THE USER - audience settled 2026-08-20

**Asked for earlier, deferred on one question: who reads it.** Three audiences were offered and the
user chose the first outright.

**Who it is for: the user.** What is guaranteed, against whom, and - as loudly - what is NOT.
Prose and diagrams. **No file names, no function names, no code**, because those are what a
maintainer needs and this is not for a maintainer. Readable end to end in one sitting, which is a
length constraint and therefore a selection constraint: everything that does not change what the
reader can conclude is cut.

**What it must contain, since the whole point is the boundary.** What the server sees (ciphertext,
sizes, timings, who talks to whom) and what it cannot see. What a community's shared key means: every
member of a community holds the key to every PUBLIC salon in it, by design, and until 2026-08-20 to
every private one too. What a private salon's own group changed, and what it did not - an admin now
JOINS and is visible in the member list; forward secrecy was decided AGAINST, deliberately, and the
document says so rather than omitting it. What leaving, being removed, and being re-invited actually
do to the keys. What a stolen device gets, and what the PIN does and does not protect.

**The two audiences declined, recorded so the choice is not re-litigated.** A maintainer's page (file
names, invariants, where each is held) would be a wiki page more, long, needing to stay synchronised
- the wiki already carries that, split across
[mls-protocol](protocols/mls-protocol.md) and [graine](protocols/channel-encryption.md). A security
assessor's document (explicit threat model, what an excluded member can do) is the most demanding of
the three and nobody has asked for one.

**Written AFTER the campaign**, because the campaign is what turns the design into something
measured, and a document that says "this is guaranteed" before anything has run is a claim about a
file rather than about a system.

### One MLS client in a SharedWorker - decided 2026-08-17

**It would remove the multi-tab class outright**, and that class is not theoretical: W2 was measured
carrying seven `canari-emse.fr` tabs, each a full MLS client with its own gateway socket and its own
in-memory counters, sharing one IndexedDB key. Two campaign findings dissolved on that fact alone
(see [testing-methodology](testing-methodology.md), rule 5), and the harness's answer - `client()`
refusing an ambiguous browser, `onetab.mjs` repairing it - protects the INSTRUMENT and not the user.

**Why it is not a queue item.** The cost is not the worker: it is the worker TRANSPORT, the startup
sequence, the PIN unlock and the Safari/mobile fallback, all of which have to be redone. Doing it
before the campaign would invalidate every verdict already taken, since the boot path is what half of
them measure.

### `dev.canari-emse.fr` becomes a real second environment - decided 2026-08-17

Today it is a proxied CNAME onto the same tunnel as production - one environment wearing two names.
The user wants trials to stop happening on prod, which is the right instinct: every reproduction is
authorised on prod only because there is nowhere else, and each one leaves debris on a shared server
that real members use.

**What has to be decided before any of it is built**, because a second environment is a second copy of
every secret and every service: whether it gets its own database or a snapshot of prod's, its own
object storage, its own push credentials (an FCM sender is per-project, so a shared one would send a
test notification to a real phone), and whether its data is ever restored from prod - which would
carry real people's ciphertext onto a machine with weaker rules. Scope that first; the tunnel and the
DNS are the easy half, and they are already in hand.

### A SECOND campaign, for everything that is not chat - asked for 2026-08-16

**It is a second campaign, not more sections on this one** - the user's framing, and it settles a
structural question. The expected size is dozens of checks per surface, where the current dashboard
already carries 18 sections in one file whose entire job is to be a LIVE summary someone can read.
Pouring a second campaign into it destroys that property. So: its own dashboard, its own manifest, its
own phase files - and `checks.mjs`'s phase list is the seam to look at first, since a second campaign
must be runnable without re-running this one.

The 18 sections were written around one class of failure: a message crossing between two transports
and two platforms, and the silent loss that class produces. That leaves whole surfaces with **no check
at all** - posts, forms, communities as a management surface, profiles, media browsing, calendar,
payments - and a surface with no check is not a surface that works, it is one nobody has asked about.

The named starting point is the **`social` notification family**: a post, a comment, a reaction on a
post, a form alert. It does **not** share the chat path - no MLS, no per-device fan-out, no outbox -
so none of the verdicts already taken transfer to it, and its delivery is server-decided, which is a
different failure mode (an audience computed wrong notifies the wrong people, and nothing on the
client can detect that).

Three things must be settled BEFORE writing checks:

- **The venue.** Every existing check sends into the two-test-account DM or `Campagne de test`
  precisely because production is shared. A post or a form alert has an AUDIENCE, so the same
  discipline needs an answer that does not exist yet: what does a test post look like that no real
  member is notified by? Until that is answered, no social check may run on prod.
- **The observer.** `srvlog.mjs` partitions its window by subject and classifies every line. The
  services behind posts and forms are not in that window today, and an unclassified window is not an
  observation.
- **What a verdict rests on.** A chat check reads the peer's DOM. A notification with an audience is
  only correct if the people who should NOT get it did not - an assertion about absence, over a
  population, needing its window sized from a measured latency rather than guessed
  ([testing-methodology](testing-methodology.md), rule 13).
