# Backlog

**Everything below is SCHEDULED** - the user's decision of 2026-08-18: the backlog and `CLAUDE.md`
are both emptied before the campaign restarts. This file is no longer a parking area; it is the
DETAIL for the queue in `CLAUDE.md`, which carries the order and one line per item. Read the order
there, the substance here, and delete an entry from BOTH when it ships.

The exception is the handful that genuinely cannot be pulled forward - blocked upstream, blocked on
an iPhone that does not exist, blocked on credentials somebody else owes, or post-campaign by the
user's own decision. Each says which it is, and `CLAUDE.md` lists them together at the end of the
queue so that "not scheduled" never has to be inferred.

Severity uses the repo scale: **P1** security, or a user-facing path that is broken - **P2**
correctness, nothing at risk - **P3** hygiene. An item with no severity is a QUESTION, not a defect,
and its first task is to answer the question rather than to write code.

Each entry states what is known, so that picking it up does not start with a rediscovery. **Delete an
entry outright when it ships** - the rule goes to [durable-rules](durable-rules.md), the story to
`CHANGELOG.md`, the mechanism to the wiki page that entry points at. An entry describing its own fix
is an entry nobody trusts to be current.

## Security - blocked upstream

### P2 - `libcrux-chacha20poly1305` panic on an overlong ciphertext buffer, in the MLS path

**The only one of the 16 open Dependabot alerts that reaches attacker-controlled input on a path that
matters.** `frontend/mls-wasm/Cargo.lock` pins 0.0.7; the advisory is fixed in 0.0.8. It arrives
transitively as `openmls_rust_crypto` → `hpke-rs` → `hpke-rs-libcrux` → `libcrux-aead` →
`libcrux-chacha20poly1305`, i.e. it IS the HPKE half of the MLS crypto provider, and it processes
ciphertext supplied by whoever sends this device a frame. A panic there kills the MLS client inside
the WASM module. Availability, not confidentiality - no key material is exposed.

**It cannot be bumped today, and this was tried rather than assumed.** `libcrux-aead 0.0.7` pins
`libcrux-chacha20poly1305 = "=0.0.7"`, and a `0.0.x` requirement is exact in Cargo semver, so the
whole chain has to move together:

| crate                      | locked | needed | available                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `libcrux-chacha20poly1305` | 0.0.7  | 0.0.8  | yes                                                  |
| `libcrux-aead`             | 0.0.7  | 0.0.8  | yes                                                  |
| `hpke-rs-libcrux`          | 0.6.1  | 0.7    | yes                                                  |
| `hpke-rs`                  | 0.6.1  | 0.7    | yes                                                  |
| `openmls_rust_crypto`      | 0.5.1  | 0.6    | **release candidates only** (0.6.0-rc.1, 0.6.0-rc.2) |

So closing this alert means shipping a release candidate of the MLS crypto provider. That is not a
dependency bump, it is an openmls provider upgrade with a full MLS re-verification behind it, and it
must not ride along with anything else.

**Re-check when `openmls_rust_crypto 0.6.0` goes stable** - that is the whole condition. Until then
the alert stays open on purpose, and the reason is here rather than in somebody's memory.

## Open questions - no code until they are answered

### P2 - what made the profile fetches fail on that device at that moment

**The MECHANISM is closed** (2026-08-16): the swallowed `catch` now accuses, a reconnection clears
`failedAt` because a failure recorded while the network was down is evidence about the network rather
than about the user, a failed lookup answers `null` instead of the label that overwrote names the
caller already had, and `displayName.spec.ts` pins all of it.

**What is owed is the DENOMINATOR, and it is a measurement rather than a change.** The log line that
makes it countable did not exist when the symptom was seen - twice on 2026-08-16, on both platforms,
nine of ten sidebar rows carrying "Utilisateur inconnu" for twenty seconds. Do not assume it is the
same fault as the avatar endpoint, and do not assume it is not.

**The denominator now rides ON the accusation (2026-08-19).** `displayName.ts` counts the lookups
that actually reached the network - a cache hit, the current user, the `system` sender and a lookup
already suppressed by the backoff are all excluded, because counting them would drive the rate
towards zero exactly as the cache warmed and measure the cache rather than the fault - and every
warn now ends `(failed/attempted lookups failed this session, X%)`. One line answers both "did a name
get lost" and "how often does that happen here", which is the question the backoff turns on.
`displayNameLookupStats()` exposes the same numbers to a test or a debug surface.

**Where the number will come from:** the campaign run logs, on both platforms. Nothing here is sent
anywhere - there is no client telemetry and this did not add any - so the rate is read from a device
or a browser console during a run, which is exactly where the symptom was seen. Server-side is not
an option: `GET /api/users/:id` is not request-logged, and a client that never reached the network
would not appear there anyway.

**Then decide about `FAILURE_BACKOFF_MS`.** A high rate argues the two-minute suppression is doing
real work against a refusing server; a rate near zero argues it is a clock hiding a name for two
minutes over a blip that the reconnection listener already handles.

### QUESTION - does an iOS attachment CONSUME the avatar cache file it is handed?

Found 2026-08-17 while writing the initials fallback, and it is a question rather than a defect
because settling it needs an iPhone. `CanariShowLocalNotification` hands `attachmentPath` straight to
`UNNotificationAttachment`, and for an avatar that path IS the durable cache file `avatar_<id>.jpg`
that `CanariFetchAvatar` writes and later re-reads. The NSE does the opposite on purpose: its
`attachImage` copies to a temp file first, carrying the comment *"an attachment URL is
consumed/moved by the OS, so we never hand it a shared cache file directly"*.

Both cannot be right. If the OS really moves the file, the app-process cache is emptied by its own
first hit and every subsequent notification re-fetches - a silent, permanent cache miss that no log
would name, since a re-fetch looks exactly like a first fetch. **What settles it is one device
observation**: notify twice for the same person with the app alive, then look for `avatar_<id>.jpg`
in the app container. If it is gone, the app path copies too, exactly as the extension does. The
initials disc is unaffected either way - it writes to `NSTemporaryDirectory()` on both.

### ANSWERED 2026-08-19 - what a full disk and an evicted store actually do

Both questions were the same shape: five years on a device and ninety days on the web are TIME
bounds, so nothing caps the store by SIZE, and the failure was undesigned rather than designed. Both
were settled by INJECTION and never on the campaign phone (the user's decision, 2026-08-19): the
appliance the campaign depends on is not the place to find out.

**Two defects fell out of asking**, and both are fixed:

- **Tauri caught a failed SQLite open and answered with IndexedDB in the same webview.** The MLS
  state persister writes `mls.bin` to the filesystem and does not follow that choice, so the group
  state would have stayed on disk while conversations and messages moved into the webview's store -
  a client that opens, looks healthy, and whose history does not match its own ratchet. And the
  cause it existed for is the one it cannot survive: the second store is on the same full disk.
- **A blocked IndexedDB upgrade never settled the promise.** `onblocked` fires when another tab
  holds an older version open - neither `onsuccess` nor `onerror` - so `init()` simply stopped, with
  no bound and nothing logged. It now rejects and says which tabs to close. The open failure also
  carries the browser's DOMException as `cause` instead of the string `'IndexedDB open error'`.

**Eviction needs no machinery, and that is a decision.** It drops the whole origin bucket, so the
next open finds no database and hands back an empty store - byte for byte what a browser that has
never seen Canari does, because everything that could have told them apart was in the bucket too. An
empty store IS a new device, the new-device path already exists, history replays from the server and
the MLS state is re-established by enrolling. A client that claimed to know it had been evicted
would be claiming knowledge it does not have.

The shapes are on [frontend/architecture](frontend/architecture.md#when-the-local-store-fails) and
pinned by `src/lib/db/storageFaults.test.ts`. **No SIZE cap is proposed**: a write that fails now
reaches its caller on every backend, which is what the cap would have been protecting.

### Is a MiGallery application worth it?

An open question, deliberately. The Canari formula (SvelteKit + Tauri) transfers, so the cost is
knowable - but MiGallery's value is a gallery that a browser already renders well, and the question
is what an app would add that the web version cannot do. Answer that before estimating anything.

## Measurements owed

### P2 - measure EGRESS over time, because two unrelated upstreams stalled in one window

The code half is fixed: `UpstreamUnreachableError` classifies at the throw, so an unreachable host is
a **502 `no-store`** never remembered, while an answer about the URL stays a cacheable 400; and
`OUTBOUND_BUDGET_MS` is the single budget, set on the `AbortController` AND on the undici dispatcher,
so the stated budget is the one that fires. Pinned by `security.controller.link-preview.spec.ts`.

**What is owed is not a code change.** Within one three-minute window on 2026-08-15, two unrelated
upstreams timed out from two different containers (`chat-delivery-service` → Wikipedia at 14:37:02,
`core-service` → gallery at 14:39:58). That is not evidence about either upstream, and it is the
second time this shape has been mistaken for one - the IPv6 reading was refuted by measuring the
components, which all came back healthy. **Measure EGRESS over time rather than the endpoints again**:
the component probes already say each is fine at the moment it is asked, so what is left to establish
is whether these stalls are CORRELATED, which a one-shot probe cannot answer by construction.

**ARMED 2026-08-19.** [`infrastructure/egress-probe/`](../../infrastructure/egress-probe/README.md)
takes a sample a minute - both stalled upstreams, the tunnel back to ourselves, a control at 1.1.1.1,
and the same target from inside `chat-delivery-service` through Node's own fetch - with DNS, connect
and TLS recorded apart from the total. `report.py` prints each conditional rate beside the base rate
it has to beat. Installed in the `canari` crontab, verified writing, `probe.err` empty.

**This item cannot be closed by working on it.** A report over a quiet week says the week was quiet.
Read the ledger the next time a stall appears in a service log; that is the moment the two
hypotheses differ, and the stall will already have been measured.

---

## Communities and permissions

Six entries came out of ONE audit on 2026-08-17, prompted by a user question rather than by a
failure. **All six are closed as of 2026-08-19** and are not repeated here - the last one, two communities
sharing a name, the user closed by decision rather than by code (2026-08-19: it is not a defect).
The five that shipped on 2026-08-18: the mechanism is on
[social-service](services/social-service.md#a-community-always-has-an-admin-or-it-has-no-members-2026-08-18),
the audit and its prod figures on [community-rework](services/community-rework.md), the rule in
[durable-rules](durable-rules.md), and the story in `CHANGELOG.md`. One remains, and it remains
because the user decided it is not a defect.

### QUESTION then P2 - a private salon is server-enforced, not end-to-end - raised 2026-08-19

**The live leak is CLOSED** (`channel-audience.spec.ts`,
[graine](protocols/channel-encryption.md#11-a-private-salons-ciphertext-was-addressed-to-the-whole-community---fixed-2026-08-19)):
every channel event is now addressed to the people who may read the salon. What is NOT closed is the
guarantee underneath it. §4.3 gives a community exactly ONE distribution group, so a private salon's
Graine seed is sealed to every member of the community. The server no longer hands those members the
ciphertext; nothing stops them reading it if they get it another way.

**The structural fix is a distribution group per private channel** - the same machinery, the same
external join, gated on `canAccessChannel` instead of workspace membership, with `channelAudience`
as its roster and the §10 roster diff pruning it. The cost is one MLS group per private salon, each
small, with a commit rate far below a community's.

**It is blocked on a question only the user can answer, and it is a product question:** an admin
today reaches every private salon WITHOUT being added to it (`canAccessChannel` falls back to
`workspace.manage`). Ambient access is free while the guarantee is server-side. Under a per-channel
group it stops being free - every promotion to admin becomes a commit on every private salon's
group, and every demotion another - and it also means the salon's members cannot tell who can read
it. The alternatives are: keep ambient access and pay the commits; make an admin JOIN a private
salon explicitly, which is visible to its members and costs one commit when it happens; or drop
admin access to private salons entirely. **Nothing should be written before this is decided** - it
determines the group's roster, which is the whole design.

**Forward secrecy is a SEPARATE axis and mostly already decided.** Graine deliberately retains
seeds so a joiner can read the past (§4.4, the user's decision of 2026-08-17). Real forward secrecy
means deleting them, which means giving that up - per channel, not globally. Channel messages are
not persisted locally either, so a forgotten seed also costs the member their own scrollback. The
lever that already exists and bounds the exposure is the one-year retention window of §8 plus
`history_visibility: joined`. Do not treat this as a defect to fix; treat it as a per-salon policy
to offer, if the user wants one.

---

## Storage and retention

The server side has a page already - [storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md) - and it
is where any measurement belongs.

### Server - can occupancy be monitored, and will it hold?

**The media half shipped 2026-08-18** and is documented on
[storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md): `/admin/storage` now separates growth (bytes
written per 7-day window) from a retention sweep that has stopped taking anything, and counts
separately the objects no sweep can EVER reach. That last one was not hypothetical -
`purgeExpiredMedia` iterates the metadata index, so an object with no entry is invisible to it for
ever, and 7 such objects (~11 MB) were already measured.

**The MLS half shipped 2026-08-19**, and this entry is closed. Postgres and Redis are no longer bare
totals: the panel lists the eight MLS tables by size with their row counts, reports the queue as four
figures (total, devices, oldest, and the DEEPEST single device queue - the one a total cannot show),
counts §5.7's WP-GHOST-1 shape continuously, and breaks Redis down by key prefix from a bounded
sample that says how much it sampled. The production baseline and the reasoning are on
[storage-forecast](infrastructure/storage-forecast.md); do not restate them here.

**Decided 2026-08-17: the panel is the whole of it, there is NO alert.** The user's call. Worth
stating what that costs rather than pretending it costs nothing - the standing rule is that a correct
mechanism with no report is found by hand a day late, and a panel is a report only for whoever opens
it. The slope is what makes it survivable: a number read once a month against a trend is enough to see
a wall coming, where a bare total is not. **§5.7's own "more than a few hundred rows" predicate is
deliberately left unarmed**: the deepest real queue is 189, so a threshold set from the last incident
would be a threshold nobody has measured against the population it would run on.

> **Already shipped, do not re-open:** _"ne garder que les messages les plus recents (dernier mois),
> et le reste recuperable en demandant l'historique a un appareil mobile"_ is exactly the device
> window plus the scrollback range request delivered in the history-reconciliation rework - web keeps
> 90 days, mobile and desktop 5 years, and reaching the top of the scrollback asks a peer for the
> range below the window. See [history-reconciliation](protocols/history-reconciliation.md) and
> `historyWindow.ts`.

> **Already shipped, do not re-open:** _"pourquoi garder plus d'un accuse de lecture sur de vieux
> messages ? Si le dernier message a ete lu, le precedent aussi"_ is the read watermark that replaced
> per-message `readBy` in the same rework - read state is now ONE timestamp per (conversation, user),
> and `readersOf` derives the per-message display from it.

## Payments

### Flipping `payment_provider` from Stripe to Lydia (WP-LYDIA-1)

**The code is not the blocker - it is already written and tested.** `PaymentProvider` is an interface
(`apps/core-service/src/payment/payment-provider.interface.ts`), `LydiaPaymentProvider` implements the
two flows that map cleanly onto it (one-off checkout, session lookup) with its own signature module
and specs, and the choice is a platform config column (`payment_provider`) that **defaults to
`stripe`**. Stripe is what runs today and nothing about that is broken.

What is missing is not code, which is why this is a question and not a P-anything: the **credentials**
and the **answers Lydia owes**. Everything that does not map - live balance and status, saved payment
methods - throws a documented error rather than faking a result, and that is deliberate: Lydia has no
live status-poll endpoint, and the saved-card flow was **explicitly dropped by the user** rather than
reimplemented, so every purchase becomes its own interactive request. Do not re-litigate that.

The full provider mapping, the remaining open questions and the credentials still owed are in
[`plans/stripe-to-lydia-migration.md`](../../plans/stripe-to-lydia-migration.md), which the wiki page
[payments](frontend/modules/payments.md) already points at.

**2026-08-19: onboarding storage coexists (see [core-service#payments](services/core-service.md#payments-stripe--lydia)),
and checkout routing now does too.** `resolvePaymentTarget` (`payment-delegation.util.ts`) takes the
active provider as a parameter and resolves against the matching column pair; `AssociationsService`/
`ProductsService` fetch it from the public `GET /api/payments/provider` before resolving, and let a
failure to reach core-service propagate rather than guess. `PaymentTarget.connectAccountId` (renamed
from `stripeAccountId`) now genuinely holds whichever provider's account is active. A Lydia
`request/do` payment is also confirmed server-side now: `confirm_url`/`cancel_url`/`expire_url` are
registered per-request, and `POST /api/payments/lydia-request-callback`
(`webhook.controller.ts`) verifies the signature and fans out to the same submission/purchase
fulfillment Stripe's webhook already used, via a shared `order_ref` encoding
(`form:<submissionId>` / `product:<productId>:<userId>`, parsed by `lydia-order-ref.ts`).

**Two things still block actually flipping the switch, both found while wiring this:**
1. **`payerRecipient` is never supplied.** `LydiaPaymentProvider.createCheckoutSession` throws
   without it (`request/do` needs the payer's email/phone), and nothing in `products.service.ts`/
   `forms.service.ts` resolves one - the interface field has existed since Phase 2 but no caller was
   ever wired to it. Needs a design decision on where the payer's email comes from for a boutique
   purchase (a logged-in user's account has no email stored in social-service today; only forms with
   a guest `input.email` field have one at all).
2. **The `business/create` `BUSINESS_VALIDATED`/`BUSINESS_UNVALIDATED` webhook is deliberately not
   built.** It has no documented signature and `vendor_token` is PUBLIC - building it as-is would let
   anyone knowing another association's vendor_token forge or break its `lydiaOnboardingComplete`,
   with no resync since Lydia sends the event once. Add "does `business/create`'s `webhook` param
   have a signature scheme?" to Livrable A below before building this.

## Post-campaign projects - decided, not scheduled

### One MLS client in a SharedWorker - decided 2026-08-17

**It would remove the multi-tab class outright**, and that class is not theoretical: W2 was measured
carrying seven `canari-emse.fr` tabs, each a full MLS client with its own gateway socket and its own
in-memory counters, sharing one IndexedDB key. Two campaign findings dissolved on that fact alone
(see [testing-methodology](testing-methodology.md), rule 5), and the harness's answer - `client()`
refusing an ambiguous browser, `onetab.mjs` repairing it - protects the INSTRUMENT and not the user.

**Why it is not a queue item.** The cost is not the worker: it is the worker TRANSPORT, the startup
sequence, the PIN unlock and the Safari/mobile fallback, all of which have to be redone. Doing it
before the campaign would invalidate every verdict already taken, since the boot path is what half of
them measure.

### `dev.canari-emse.fr` becomes a real second environment - decided 2026-08-17

Today it is a proxied CNAME onto the same tunnel as production - one environment wearing two names.
The user wants trials to stop happening on prod, which is the right instinct: every reproduction is
authorised on prod only because there is nowhere else, and each one leaves debris on a shared server
that real members use.

**What has to be decided before any of it is built**, because a second environment is a second copy of
every secret and every service: whether it gets its own database or a snapshot of prod's, its own
object storage, its own push credentials (an FCM sender is per-project, so a shared one would send a
test notification to a real phone), and whether its data is ever restored from prod - which would
carry real people's ciphertext onto a machine with weaker rules. Scope that first; the tunnel and the
DNS are the easy half, and they are already in hand.

### A SECOND campaign, for everything that is not chat - asked for 2026-08-16

**It is a second campaign, not more sections on this one** - the user's framing, and it settles a
structural question. The expected size is dozens of checks per surface, where the current dashboard
already carries 18 sections in one file whose entire job is to be a LIVE summary someone can read.
Pouring a second campaign into it destroys that property. So: its own dashboard, its own manifest, its
own phase files - and `checks.mjs`'s phase list is the seam to look at first, since a second campaign
must be runnable without re-running this one.

The 18 sections were written around one class of failure: a message crossing between two transports
and two platforms, and the silent loss that class produces. That leaves whole surfaces with **no check
at all** - posts, forms, communities as a management surface, profiles, media browsing, calendar,
payments - and a surface with no check is not a surface that works, it is one nobody has asked about.

The named starting point is the **`social` notification family**: a post, a comment, a reaction on a
post, a form alert. It does **not** share the chat path - no MLS, no per-device fan-out, no outbox -
so none of the verdicts already taken transfer to it, and its delivery is server-decided, which is a
different failure mode (an audience computed wrong notifies the wrong people, and nothing on the
client can detect that).

Three things must be settled BEFORE writing checks:

- **The venue.** Every existing check sends into the two-test-account DM or `Campagne de test`
  precisely because production is shared. A post or a form alert has an AUDIENCE, so the same
  discipline needs an answer that does not exist yet: what does a test post look like that no real
  member is notified by? Until that is answered, no social check may run on prod.
- **The observer.** `srvlog.mjs` partitions its window by subject and classifies every line. The
  services behind posts and forms are not in that window today, and an unclassified window is not an
  observation.
- **What a verdict rests on.** A chat check reads the peer's DOM. A notification with an audience is
  only correct if the people who should NOT get it did not - an assertion about absence, over a
  population, needing its window sized from a measured latency rather than guessed
  ([testing-methodology](testing-methodology.md), rule 13).
