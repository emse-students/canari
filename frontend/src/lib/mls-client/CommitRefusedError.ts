/**
 * The server's epoch gate refused a staged commit, which was then rolled back without a merge.
 *
 * A TYPE, BECAUSE A CALLER HAS TO TELL "SOMEBODY ELSE'S COMMIT WON" FROM "THIS FAILED". Until
 * 2026-09-28 the refusal was a plain `Error` whose only discriminator was its text, and the one
 * caller that needed the difference - the admitter of channel-encryption section 20 - gave up on
 * every refusal alike. Measured by NOTIF-21 that day: the newcomer's two live web clients joined
 * the key group by their own external commits in the same second the admitter's Add was built, the
 * Add was refused `epoch_mismatch`, and the newcomer's dead phone - the one device that could not
 * act for itself - was never added.
 *
 * The message keeps its historical spelling so a log reader and older assertions read it the same.
